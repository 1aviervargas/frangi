# Frangi filter to enhance cryo-EM maps

In this work, we improve cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions by using a multiscale tubular filter.

The Matlab code is in the Code folder. Please see the Example folder to see how to use the code. The cryo-EM maps to run this example can be downloaded from:
